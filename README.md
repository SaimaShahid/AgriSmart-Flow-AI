# AgriSmart-Flow-AI

An AI-powered smart irrigation system built for the Lablab.ai hackathon. Uses Google Gemini 1.5 Flash for intelligent decision-making and Vultr for scalable cloud hosting to optimize water flow in agriculture

# AgriSmart: AI-Powered Smart Flow Control 🌾💧

AgriSmart is an innovative Agri-Tech solution designed to optimize water usage in farming. By combining real-time sensor data with the decision-making power of Google Gemini AI, the system ensures that irrigation only happens when necessary, preventing water waste and protecting crop health.

🚀 Key Features
AI-Driven Decisions: Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash to analyze soil moisture and weather forecasts for intelligent irrigation.

Cloud Hosted: Backend is fully deployed on Vultr Infrastructure for high availability and low latency.

Water Conservation: Automatically stops flow during predicted rainfall, even if soil is dry.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash.

Infrastructure: Vultr Cloud Computing.

Language: Python.

📋 Installation & Usage
Clone the repository.

Install dependencies: pip install -q -U google-generativeai.
